I received this question: Can hashtag#AI help with Cash Forecasting?

Most finance professionals are still doing this with spreadsheets, despite how much Python and AI can now automate and improve the process.

That’s why I created this AI Cash Forecasting Template for FP&A teams.

It's a PDF guide that walks you through using machine learning models (like XGBoost or Prophet) for cash flow forecasting — no prior coding expertise needed.

You can also get the Python code I am using, just comment AI for Cash Forecasting and I can send it!

Use this framework and learn to:

✅ Prompt an LLM (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) to generate Python code and model your cash forecast

I added the prompt in the pdf and will add also to the 1st comment

✅ Know what data to use (AR, AP, Payroll, Revenue, etc.)

✅Learn where to run Python Code

- Easiest to Start → Google Colab

- If you run on Microsoft → Visual Studio

- If you prefer to stay in Excel → Python in Excel

And once you're up and running, here's how you iterate and improve your forecast using AI:

Feature engineering
Adding external drivers
Increasing data frequency
Model comparison & stacking

I believe AI in hashtag#finance and FP&A isn’t about replacing us. 

It’s about empowering us to focus on insights, not just data crunching.

Hope this helps in your journey to use AI for Finance!
