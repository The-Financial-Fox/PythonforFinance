If I'd need to do an AI for FP&A and Finance Roadmap in 2025 this is what I'd do:

1: Know the Possibilities of AI in Finance

AI is not just ChatGPT — and it’s not just about answering questions.

It’s about transforming how Finance operates.

But it’s hard to know what you don’t know.

That’s why the first step is awareness.

Get familiar with what’s actually possible.

Here are just a few examples of how AI can be used in Finance:

✅ Automated variance analysis – AI detects anomalies, highlights drivers, and explains them in seconds.

 ✅Forecasting & scenario planning – Build predictive models that adapt in real-time.

 ✅Expense & invoice classification – Automate tedious reconciliations and improve audit readiness.

Before building your roadmap, open the window to what’s possible.

2. Choose an implementation partner and tool 

I have this resource with 30+ AI tools for Finance below

But if you want to keep it simple,

My top suggestion is OpenAI and ChatGPT 

If your company just uses Microsoft products, then explore Copilot 

If your company just uses Google products, then explore Gemini 

3. Get your team trained on that tool 

No matter what LLM and AI company you choose to partner with, I think this is one of the most important steps. 

Every tool has its features

The more you know about them, the more you can do with AI for Finance 

Some examples: 

GPTs from OpenAI: A game changer, you can add your policies, files and data in minutes and you can create a chatbot for your entire company 

Colab AI Agent from Google: Have an AI finance data scientist at your disposal to explore how to find the main drivers of profitability or do scenario modeling 

Copilot in Excel with Python from Microsoft: This can unlock data insights in seconds. 

My point is that every tool has its secrets. 

And you can spend hours and hours learning them. 

But AI changes every day. 

So instead of trying to keep up, choose a learning partner and get your team trained on use cases of AI in Finance. 

If you need help with that, let me know and I can give you suggestions 

Some options: 

AI Finance Club
Self Paced Courses 
LinkedIn Learning Courses 

4. Prioritise use cases 

Use my framework in the pdf

Focus on Quick Wins and Major Projects 

Keep some Fill Ins ready 

Avoid Thankless Tasks

5. Create a Governance & Compliance Plan

AI is powerful—but it needs guardrails.

Define what data can and can’t be used

Set standards for review and oversight

This ensures your AI efforts are safe, ethical, and scalable.

6: Track and Share Wins

Start small, but celebrate results.

Did an AI tool reduce reporting time by 50%?

Did automation save your analysts 10 hours a week?

Share it with the team and leadership.

Build an Internal prompt Library and start documenting every AI idea or request that comes up—big or small.

Momentum builds when people see the value.
